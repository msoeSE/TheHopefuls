This seed repo serves as an MEAN starter for anyone looking to get a MEAN fullstack app up and running with Angular 2, TypeScript(on the front-end), and ES6/ES7 (on the back-end) fast. Using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. We're also using Protractor for our end-to-end story and Karma for our unit tests.

- Best practices in file and application organization for Angular 2.
- Ready to go build system using Webpack for working with TypeScript.
- Hot module reloading for the front-end à la Webpack.
- Angular 2 examples that are ready to go when experimenting with Angular 2.
- A great MEAN seed repo for anyone who wants to start their project.
- Testing Angular 2 code with Jasmine and Karma.
- Coverage with Istanbul and Karma
- End-to-end Angular 2 code using Protractor.
- Type manager with Typings
- Sass preprocessor linting and compiling
- Automatic documentation for all project related Sass, TypeScript, and JavaScript files with Docco; front-end and back-end

The rest of the stack features:

- [Express](https://www.expressjs.com/) ready for ES6/ES7 code through transpiling with [Babel 6](https://babeljs.io/),
- [Socket.io](https://www.socket.io/) for real time event-based communication.
- [Mongoose](https://www.mongoosejs.com/) for modeling [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) objects within [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
- Support for the [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) CSS preprocessor.

## Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.ts`](/src/app/app.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/datatypevoid/ng2-mean-webpack.git

# change directory to our repo
cd ng2-mean-webpack

# add required global libraries
 npm install -g typings webpack-dev-server concurrently

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# create configuration json file for env vars
# save in `config/` as `config.json`
{
  "ENV" : "development",
  # Cannot be 8080 as this conflicts with our Webpack dev server
  "PORT" : 3000,
  "MONGO_URI" : {
    "DEVELOPMENT" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]",
    "PRODUCTION" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]",
    "TEST" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]"
  },
  # Generate your own 256-bit WEP key here:
  # http://randomkeygen.com/
  # Note that you don't need to use specifically
  # this, but it will certainly suffice
  "SESSION_SECRET" : "355FC4FE9348639B4E4FED1B8E93C"
}

# build code
npm run build

# start up the stack

# this command runs two commands in parallel via `concurrently`:
# `npm run server` starts up `webpack-dev-server` allowing for
# hot module reloading
# `npm` run watch` uses `webpack` to watch the necessary files
# and build on file change
npm start

# in a separate terminal:
# start `Express` server

## File Structure

We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:

```

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:

- `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
- Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.1.x`+ and NPM `2.14.x`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:

- `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
- `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
- `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
- `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
- `typings` (`npm install --global typings`)
- `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing

- `fork` this repo
- `clone` your fork
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `typings install` to install necessary typings
- create `config.json` **_see below_**
- `npm run build` to build necessary front-end code with Webpack
- `npm start` to enable hot module reloading and build on file change
- In a new terminal, `node server` to start the server for the first time

## config.json

The `server.conf.js` file is expecting certain `environment` `variables` to be set within `Node`. The `env.conf.js` has functions to check whether the expected `environment` `variables` have been setup before proceeding to start up the rest of the server. You can create a file called `config.json` and store it in the `config` directory that looks something like this:

```
{
  "ENV" : "development",
  # MAKE SURE PORT IS NOT 8080 OR WHATEVER THE WEBPACK
  # DEV SERVER PORT IS SET TO
  "PORT" : 3000,
  "MONGO_URI" : {
    "DEVELOPMENT" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]",
    "PRODUCTION" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]",
    "TEST" : "mongodb://[username:password]@host[:port]"
  },
  # Generate your own 256-bit WEP key here:
  # http://randomkeygen.com/
  # Note that you don't need to use specifically
  # this, but it will certainly suffice
  "SESSION_SECRET" : "355FC4FE9348639B4E4FED1B8E93C"
}
```

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies and created your `config.json` file, you can now run the app. First, you must start up the back-end server in a separate terminal using the `gulp serve` command. This will fire up our Express app using `nodemon`, which will watch for file changes and restart our backend when necessary. Next use the `npm start` command in the original terminal which runs two `npm` scripts in parallel: `npm run server` to start `webpack-dev-server` for building our front-end in the computer's memory, enabling hot module reloadig; `npm run watch` to watch all of the front-end files and build them upon changes. You can now fire up your favorite web browser and visit the running application at `localhost:8080`!

### server

```bash
# development
# package front-end files with Webpack and hot reload
# upon any changes
npm start
# use `Gulp` in a second terminal to run the Express
# app responsible for our back-end
gulp serve
# optionally use `Gulp` in a third terminal to auto
# generate documentation and lint `Sass`
gulp

# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### start `Express` back-end

```bash
gulp serve
```

### build documentation

```bash
gulp build:docs
```

### watch and build documentation

```bash
gulp watch:docs
```

### watch and lint sass

```bash
gulp watch:sass
```

### build files

```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### watch and build files

```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests

```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests

```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)

```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)

```bash
npm run webdriver:start
# in another terminal
npm run e2e:live
```

# Contributing

You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript

> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler

TypeScript 1.7.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor

We have good experience using these editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

# Typings

> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you need to include external Type Definitions with Typings

## Use latest Typings module

```
npm install --global typings
```

## Custom Type Definitions

When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with typings

```
typings install node --save
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```

If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```

You can include your type definitions in this file until you create one for the typings registry see [typings/registry](https://github.com/typings/registry)

# Frequently asked questions

- What's the current browser support for Angular 2 Beta?

  - Please view the updated list of [browser support for Angular 2](https://github.com/angularclass/awesome-angular2#current-browser-support-for-angular-2)

- Why is my service, aka provider, is not injecting parameter correctly?

  - Please use `@Injectable()` for your service for typescript to correctly attach the metadata (this is a TypeScript problem)

- How do I run protractor with node 0.12.x?

  - please check out this repo to use the old version of protractor [#146](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/146/files)
